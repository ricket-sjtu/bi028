The parts of data and programs are transferred from disk to cache memory by operating system, from where CPU can access them.\n",
    "   - **Primary Memory/Main Memory (内存/主存)**：Primary memory holds only those data and instructions on which computer is currently working. It has limited capacity and data is lost when power is switched off. It is generally made up of semiconductor device. These memories are not as fast as registers. The data and instruction required to be processed reside in main memory. It is divided into two subcategories RAM (Random access memory, 随机存取存储) and ROM (只读存储).\n",
    "   - **Secondary Memory (外存)**：This type of memory is also known as external memory or non-volatile. It is slower than main memory. These are used for storing data/Information permanently. CPU directly does not access these memories instead they are accessed via input-output routines. Contents of secondary memories are first transferred to main memory, and then CPU can access it. For example : disk, CD-ROM, DVD etc."

Computers can only understand numbers, so an ASCII code is the *numerical representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort*. ASCII was developed a long time ago and now the non-printing characters are rarely used for their original purpose. Below is the ASCII character table and this includes descriptions of the first 32 non-printing characters. ASCII was actually designed for use with teletypes and so the descriptions are somewhat obscure. If someone says they want your CV however in ASCII format, all this means is they want 'plain' text with no formatting such as tabs, bold or underscoring - the raw format that any computer can understand.
